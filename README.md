**Features:**

* Create new student records
* Display all existing student records
* Search for a specific student record based on roll number
* Modify an existing student record
* Delete a student record

**Requirements:**

* C++ compiler (e.g., g++ on Linux/macOS, Visual Studio on Windows)

**Instructions:**

1. Compile the code:

   ```bash
   g++ student_record_system.cpp -o student_record_system
   ```

2. Run the program:

**Contributing:**

This is a basic project and can be extended to include features like:

* User authentication
* Storing additional student information (e.g., address, phone number)
* Implementing different sorting and searching algorithms
* Adding graphical user interface (GUI)

Feel free to modify and improve the code based on your needs.
